		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p>To advocate on behalf of the Somali Bantu and other similarly disadvantaged refugees to access healthcare, professional and educational resources so that families can make a successful cultural, economic, and social transition to life in the United States; and to provide services to assist families in becoming economically stable, civically engaged members of their new community in San Diego, CA.</p>
	<h2>Somali Bantu health care plan</h2>

<p>We  provide culturally and linguistically-appropriate comprehensive health assessments, and other health services, to newly arrived refugees, asylums, victims of severe forms of human trafficking (federally-certified), and other eligible entrants to assist them in becoming self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Better health information systems, increased application of epidemiologic methods of analysis, strong liaisons with public health organizations and schools of public health, and effective partnerships with local health agencies and professionals.  
Patient provider communication is paramount to providing effective clinical care to patients from diverse populations. Language can be a barrier to accessing health care. Many patients from diverse populations are of limited English proficiency (LEP), meaning they cannot understand English in a manner that facilitates effective communication with a person who uses English as a primary language.  Comprised of four standards:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Offering interpretation services and translated materials at no cost</li>
	<li>Providing patients verbal and written notice, in their language of choice, to inform them of their right to interpreter services.</li>
	<li>Assuring competence of interpreters provided</li>
	<li>Making available easy-to-understand materials and signage, in languages spoken in the community.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Providing culturally competent care starts with an awareness of one’s own culture, as well as an understanding of the needs associated with providing care to people of different cultures. With this knowledge, our organization can begin to develop cross-functional strategies to change organizational practices, physical environments, and communication practices at all levels and across all disciplines. Somali Bantu Association of America suggests providing training and education as a standard toward achieving culturally competent care. Noted that ongoing staff training was an “essential component of successful cultural competence programs.</p>

	<h2>What Is Pre-Literacy?</h2>
<p>Pre-literate learners come from areas where there is no written language, or where learners have not been exposed to it, such as Hmong from Laos or Bantu from Somalia. Non-literates can neither read nor write their own language. SBAOA developed its own ESL (English as a Second Language) curriculum to address the special needs of pre-literate & non-literate refugees in San Diego.
While the Somali Bantu have been labeled as one of the most culturally and economically oppressed groups in the world, they have proven to be positive in their desires to succeed, highly adaptable and industrious. Due to their exclusion from formal education and positions in Somalia that require literacy, the Bantu have remained largely illiterate. Upon arrival in the Dadaab refugee camps, few, if any, of the Bantu were observed to be literate. Without any accurate data, it can only be said that the rate of literacy for the Bantu is low and certainly well below the United Nations estimate of 25%.</p>
<p>Their general exclusion from mainstream Somali society has hindered the Bantu from participating in the education system. The Somali government has established far fewer schools in Bantu regions than in towns inhabited by dominant clans. This denial of access to education represents one of the most egregious and detrimental examples of Somali institutional discrimination against the Bantu.</p>
<p>General discrimination by the majority Somalis has further excluded the Bantu from virtually any but the most menial positions in Somali-run organizations. These positions generally do not require literacy, thus further decreasing the need for the Bantu to pursue formal education.</p>
<p>IOM (International Organization for Migration) officials report that while some Bantu children in the refugee camps attend primary school, only an estimated 5% of all Bantu refugees (mostly males) have been formally educated. Some Somali refugees refused to allow their children to study alongside Bantu children. This resulted in some Somali students attending separate classes, and, in some cases, separate schools, from the Bantu.</p>
