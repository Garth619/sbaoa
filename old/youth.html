		<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>Our mission is to reduce the risk factor currently facing the
Somali Bantu Youth’s in San Diego, California.</p>

<h2>Vision Statement</h2> 
<p>Our purpose is to:</p>
<ol>

<li>      Empower and enhance the Somali Bantu Youth of San Diego</li>

<li>      Help the Somali Bantu youths attain secondary, post secondary, 
technical, vocational, and other types of education</li>

<li>      Promote social and emotional self-reliance </li>

<li>      Provide and facilitate training for the Somali Bantu youths to ensure 
the development of various life skills, gain employment, community opportunities, 
and develop strength. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Youth Program: Beyond the Horizon</h2> <h2>Who We Are</h2>

<p>The Somali Bantu Youth’s soccer team is a volunteer 
no-profit organization designed to offer a fun and competitive 
environment for the youths. We are also geared to maintain a 
drug and violence free environment</p>

<p>Our Goal:</p>
<ol>
<li>To provide an affordable venue that promotes
interaction between youth and young adults of 
various communities and ages, especially those 
considered at risk (defined) as minorities (with low income)</li>
<li>To provide a form in which youths can be mentored
in terms of spiritual and physical knowledge by respectful
individuals </li>
<li>To provide a positive environment and respite for youths
from negative peer pressures, criminal propensities, 
dysfunctional families, and other environmental
or sourced-economic factors</li>
<li>Volunteer opportunities</li>
<li>Providing youths and young adults the responsibilities 
and skills that they can develop to achieve success and 
confidence in the future endeavors</li>
</ol>
<p>Our Objective:</p>

<p>To fulfill a community need by promoting a sense of
relationship among youths and young adults of both 
Somali Bantu and non-Somali Bantu backgrounds in the context of 
multicultural athletic events. Using multicultural 
athletic events is relevant to achieve these goals 
 as it promotes social interaction, cultural integration, team-work, co-operations, 
communication, and a sense of accomplishment amongst 
the participants.</p>

<p>Future Services:</p>

<p>In the future, the organization plans to 
increase and expand its current services to 
add new and better programs such as: training 
to manage and budget money, as the Somali Bantu
youths may not be familiar with these skills. 
The organization will maintain programs that will 
(based on needs of the communities) develop, 
help and courage, provide a good future for Somali Bantu.</p>

<p>Sports:</p>

<p>The Somali Bantu Soccer Team (SBST) – The Somali 
Bantu youths love to play soccer!  We have a team 
to motivate the youth, and hope to provide indoor 
games during other seasons. During the summer, 
the SBST will compete with other teams in neighboring 
states such as Seattle, Oregan, Ohio, Nevada, Texas, 
Arizona, Minnesota, etc. to help the young Somali
Bantu youth interact with other youths. </p>

 

<p>Traditional Counseling and Mentoring Services:</p>

<p>The Somali Bantu youth meet many stressful situations in 
Somalia which negatively affects their progress with education.  
We as the Somali Bantu Youth Association of America, 
provide counseling for the them.
We will sit with them one-on-one to talk about issues and problems.
  The organization also provides mentoring 
activities with the youths.</p>
