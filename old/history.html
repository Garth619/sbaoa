		<h2>Somali Bantu History and Culture</h2>


	<p>The Somali Bantu are descendants of slaves by the 
	Sultan of Zanzibar in the 18th and 19th centuries. 
	From 1991 to date, Somalia has been in a state of 
	anarchy where many Somalis are displaced or have fled 
	to neighboring countries to avoid violence.  The United 
	Nations and other parties have placed Somali Bantu in 
	refugee camps in Kenya.  It is from these camps that the 
	Somali Bantu have been brought to the United States. Somali
	Bantu were resettled in several different states from coast 
	to coast.  The Bantu have been a nomadic people with a rich 
	diversity in culture and heritage.  Much of Somali Bantu 
	traditional culture has its roots in religion, with some 
	traditional beliefs from their ancestors.</p>

<h3>Geography</h3>

<p>Somalia is located on the east coast of Africa.  The majority 
of Somali Bantu people reside in the valleys and rural areas of 
the Lower Juba and Middle Juba Shabelle regions.  The Somali Bantu 
are considered a minority group.</p>

<h3>Livelihood</h3>  

	<p>The main livelihood of Somali Bantu depend on irrigation and 
	seasonal crop production.  They grow both cash and subsistence 
	crops, such as sesame, maize, tobacco, peas, vegetables and fruits. 
	The Somali Bantu live together in permanent agricultural villages. 
	They differ from other Somali clans in that they are a sedentary 
	population, not pastoralists like other Non-Bantu Somalis who live 
	in rural areas.</p> 

<h3>Muslim Religion</h3>

	<p>The Somali-Bantu are predominantly Sunna Muslim.  They are moderate 
	in their Muslim Beliefs.  They attend small mosques in their villages,
	praying five times a day.  The Islamic religion does not permit Muslims 
	to eat pig, warthog or mammals with upper front teeth (horse).  In addition 
	this, drinking alcohol is prohibited for Muslims and is seen as a sin.</p> 

<h3>Pets</h3>
  
	<p>Somali Bantu do not believe they should touch a dog. It is offensive to 
	omali Bantu to have a dog greet, sniff, and rub its wet mouth, or wet body, 
	against them.  Obviously dogs are not viewed as members of the family.</p>  

<h3>Somali Bantu Holidays</h3> 
	
	<p>Somali Bantu observe three Muslim holidays and several important life 
	cycle rituals. The yearly calendar is Lunar and the major holidays are 
	as follows:</p> 

         <ul class="holiday">
         <li>Idul-fitri</li>
         <li>Idul-adha</li>
         <li>Mowliid</li>
         </ul>

<h3>Greeting</h3> 

	<p>Like other Muslims who practice Islam, men don’t shake a married woman’s 
	hand when greeting. The women, too, do not shake men’s hands if they are 
	not spouses. Sometimes the Somali Bantu people wave their hand for greeting 
	if the person is far away, while they say “Bariida” which means “good morning” 
	or “Hergela” “good afternoon.”</p> 

<h3>Marriage</h3>

	<p>Somali Bantu practice polygamy. Men marry up to four wives at a time in 
	accordance with the Islamic faith. Relatives and family members are determined 
	by the father’s family. Both men and women marry as young as 15 years old. If
	the groom tells his future father-in-law, “I want marry your daughter,” it is 
	seen as offensive. Instead he says, “I want to have your daughter for bearing 
	young ones in the future.” </p>

<h3>Pregnancy and Family Size</h3>

	 <p>Childbearing usually starts immediately after the marriage.  The average 
	 Somali-Bantu family size is seven to ten children; more when they practice 
	 polygamy.</p> 

<h3>Illness</h3>

	<p>Somali Bantu believe that people get sick because of invisible creatures 
	locally known as “jinni”.  This is particularly the case when someone has 
	a mental health problem.  When a person appears to be mentally ill, families 
	and relatives will sell animals and use the money to hire specialized Jinni 
	healers.</p> 

<h3>Respect and Behavior</h3>  

	<p>Somali Bantu communities place great importance on showing respect. Children 
	are taught to show respect by not looking their father, mother, brother, sister 
	and other Somali Bantu elders in the eyes. If children look elders in the eye 
	it’s considered disrespectful. Somali Bantu have a strong tradition of telling
	their children that they should respect anyone who is older than they are. 
	They are taught that whoever is the same age as their father, mother, brothers,
	sisters, grandfather, grandmother, uncle and aunt is to be treated with 
	equivalent respect.</p> 

<h3>Work</h3>

	<p>Somali Bantu men typically go out and earn a living for their families, 
	while wives stay home and take care of the children and household chores. 
	In some families, husbands and wives go out and work on the farm. Men make 
	the economic decisions for the family. The Somali-Bantu are industrious and 
	open to learning the new skills necessary for successful resettlement.</p>
