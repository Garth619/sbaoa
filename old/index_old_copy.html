		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p>Our mission is to facilitate the resettlement of the Somali Bantu and to integrate cultural and life skill training programs within the community. We seek to promote English literacy, promote awareness of American culture, and encourage self-sufficiency among the Somali Bantu community in the United States, especially in San Diego. 
</p>

		<h2>Somali Bantu Refugees Travel to 
				America's Heartland</h2>

	<p>In the 1880s Bantu tribe’s people were torn from their homelands in 
	southern Africa and shipped to Somalia as slaves. Always targets of 
	discrimination, they disproportionately fell victims to violence when 
	the Somali government disintegrated in 1991. Even in refugee camps 
	they were persecuted by fellow Somalis — robbed, raped, and forced 
	into hard labor. Repatriation attempts to their original homeland 
	failed.</p>
	<p>The U.S. State Department granted asylum to 15,000 Bantu Somalis, 
	paving the way for this Somali Bantu tribe to leave behind forever 
	the Kenyan refugee camps where they have languished for a dozen years.
	With this announcement, one of the most primitive civilizations on 
	earth prepared to assimilate into one of the most advanced.</p> 
	<p>The Somali Bantu Association of America, located in San Diego, CA, 
	is a nonprofit organization committed to the effective integration 
	of Somali Bantu and other refugee communities, to the United States,
	through the provision of social and economic programs.  Somali Bantu refugees 
	have been arriving in the United States since 1991 after spending more 
	than a decade in Kenyan’s Refugee Camps or other peaceful countries. 
	Prior to war in Somali regions, the Somali Bantu people suffered discrimination
	and economic marginalization in the early 1990’s.</p>
<p>We are the Somali Bantu Association of America, and we are requesting supportive 
help from the United States Government. Our goal is to help all refugees as it 
relates to Housing, Education, Vocational training, and U.S. Employment services. 
Basically we need help!</p>
	
	<p>If you are interested in supporting us in any way by volunteering time, 
	services, and getting involved in any of our programs, we would love to 
	hear from you! Anything you can share with us will help, and will surely 
	be appreciated.</p>
